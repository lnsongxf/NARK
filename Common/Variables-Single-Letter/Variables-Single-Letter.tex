In a just universe, anyone who used a single Roman letter for a variable name would roast in search-and-replace hell for an eternity.

It is only slightly less boneheaded to name a variable after a letter in another commonly used alphabet (say, \texttt{delta}).  Your future self (and other users) will not know which of the many possible meanings of $\delta$ you had in mind.

But brevity is a virtue.  A single letter {\it in combination with a modifier or two} (`\texttt{cLvlMin}' as the minimum level of individual consumption, say) is fine -- so long as the reader has some reason to expect that the letter \texttt{c} signifies the level of consumption of an individual.  

That is the spirit in which we offer preferred interpretations for the Roman letters below.  The upper case 
version generally should be interpreted as reflecting an aggregated version of the variable (at the level of the whole economy, or of the whole market being studied), while the lower case indicates the level of an individual consumer or firm or other entity.

When an alternative object with a meaning similar to, but distinct from, the definitions below is needed, please use a multi-letter name to represent it.  For example, please do not use $W$ for wealth (if some measure of wealth that differs from $\ALev$, $\BLev$, $\HLev$, or $\NLev$ is needed); instead use, say, \texttt{Wlth} or \texttt{Wealth}.

The variable definitions below are intended to designate the most common usages of letters in the Roman alphabet.  Of course, contributors can use any of these for other purposes, but we prefer that a non-single-letter designation be used when an alternative is contemplated.  For example, please do not use $W$ for wealth (if some measure of wealth is needed); instead use, say, \texttt{Wlth} or \texttt{Wealth}. 

\begin{table}[h]

\\  \texttt{Dur}   & - & Stock of durable good
\\  \texttt{Div}   & - & Dividends

\\  \texttt{Labor} & - & Quantity of labor

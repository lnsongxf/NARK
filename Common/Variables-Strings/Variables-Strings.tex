There are a few more objects that are likely to be used extensively in ARK projects than there are Roman letters.  We present preferred usages here

Of course, contributors can use any of these for other purposes, but we prefer that a non-single-letter designation be used when an alternative is contemplated.  For example, please do not use $W$ for wealth (if some measure of wealth is needed); instead use, say, \texttt{Wlth} or \texttt{Wealth}.

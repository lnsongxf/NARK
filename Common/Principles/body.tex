Our choices aim to balance a number of criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\item Brevity (nobody wants to type long names over and over)
\item Uniqueness (in case you want to search-and-replace, the string should be unique)
\item Mnemonic quality (it should be easy to remember what represents what)
\item Ubiquity (objects defined herein will appear in many projects)
\item Combinatoriality (easy to mix and match our recommendations)
\end{itemize}

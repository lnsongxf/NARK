  When measuring change over time, lower-case variables reflect rates
  while the corresponding upper-case variable connects adjacent discrete periods.\footnote{This
  convention rarely conflicts with the usage we endorse elsewhere of
  indicating individual-level variables by the lower and aggregate
  variables by the upper case.}$^{,}$\footnote{If there is a need for the continuous-time 
representation, we endorse use of the discrete-time rate defined below.  Any
author who needs a continuous-time rate, a discrete-time rate, and a discrete-time factor
is invited to invent their own notation.}  So, for example, if the annual interest rate is $\rfree=0.03$ or three percent, then 
the annual interest factor is $\Rfree=1.03$.%\footnote{In the rare cases where it is necessary to distinguish between a continuous-time rate and a discrete-time rate -- for example, when there is an analytical result available in continuous time -- the variable in question can be modified by \texttt{Cnt} or \texttt{Dsc}.}

We depart from the upper-lower case scheme when the natural letter to use has an even more natural or urgent use elsewhere in our scheme.
A particularly common example occurs in the case of models like \cite{blanchardFinite} in which 
individual agents are subject to a Poisson probability of death.  Because death was common in the 
middle ages, we use the archaic Gothic font for the death rate; and the probability of survival is the cancellation of the probability of death:
